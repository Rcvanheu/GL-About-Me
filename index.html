    <p>Hello! My name is Ryan van Heugten and I am a freshman at NC State.
    I am an exploratory studies major but I hope to soon switch into aerospace engineering, physics, or mathematics.
    I love the problem solving aspects of all three of my prospective majors, it makes the science behind the topic remain fun.
    Hopefully I can take one of those professions into a research job in the future.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p> My last job was a lifeguard. I worked at two different pools in the past, but both were part of the City of Raleigh Aquatics Program.
    I enjoyed the ability to work outside and meet new people.
