    <p>Hell! My name is Ryan van Heugten and I am a student at NC State University.
    I am <em>currently</em> an exploratory studies major, but hoping to transfer into <strong>Aerospace<strong> engineering soon.
    Both of my parents work at the university so it is essentially a second home for me.
    I love both <ins>performing</ins> and listening to music, playing soccer, swimming and eating god food.
    I also enjoy learning more about the world around me.

    <p>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH is my favourite <del>element</del> chemical formula. E = mc<sup>2</sup> is my favorite physics formula.</p>
